# Wheel Of Fortune - Unity
- All rewards are stored as Scriptable Object(WheelContent) in Resources/WheelContentObjects. You can easily edit the content and drop rate of each or add new rewards within the file. 
- Wheels and other reusable items are stored in the AddressablesManager script and called from there. 
- Most of the UI animations were done with DOTween. 
- You can find the APK file in the root.
