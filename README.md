# Wheel Of Fortune - Unity
- All rewards are stored as Scriptable Object(WheelContent) in Resources/WheelContentObjects. I randomly gave the drop rates of the rewards but you can easily edit the contents and drop rates of each or add new rewards within the file. 
- Wheels and other reusable items are stored in the AddressablesManager script and called from there. 
- Most of the UI animations were done with DOTween.
- The rarity settings of the rewards has been created as Scriptable Object.
